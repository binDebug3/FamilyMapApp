/**
 * This is a mock client used for pass off of the CS240 Family Map Server project.
 * Since the next project is an Android Client, we decided to obfuscate this code
 * in order to preserve the integrity of the learning process for the next project.
 * <p>
 * However, obfuscated code is intentionally hard to read. Therefore, by mercy of
 * the professors, we have included comments for you in order to know exactly what
 * is happening in each test without giving you the actual code.
 * <p>
 * REMINDER: This is the pass off driver. This is not a class of free tests that you
 * can use to debug your own program. Write your own tests first! Verify functionality
 * by running api commands from your own computer using localhost. After your responses
 * look correct on the web api, then you may move on to using this test driver.
